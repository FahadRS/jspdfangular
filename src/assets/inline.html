<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:00 - 00:00:03</strong></em>
<br /> These are the five most valuable companies in America.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:03 - 00:00:04</strong></em>
<br /> Notice anything. They're all tech companies,
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:04 - 00:00:11</strong></em>
<br /> and their dominance is attracting attention from watchdog groups that say their market power is harming competition and the economy.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:11 - 00:00:13</strong></em>
<br /> Is it time to break up big tech?
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:13 - 00:00:14</strong></em>
<br /> To answer that
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:14 - 00:00:18</strong></em>
<br /> you have to understand how tech has exploded for our purposes.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:18 - 00:00:22</strong></em>
<br /> Let's imagine the top five tech giants as PAC man or pack companies.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:22 - 00:00:25</strong></em>
<br /> Except in this game there are no ghosts around to avoid.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:25 - 00:00:28</strong></em>
<br /> No Blinky know Clyde those ghosts are US regulators.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:28 - 00:00:30</strong></em>
<br /> For the past decade EU S has.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:30 - 00:00:38</strong></em>
<br /> Been mostly hands off with big tech companies letting them become even bigger by swallowing smaller rivals or entering new markets.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:38 - 00:00:40</strong></em>
<br /> Bloomberg Data show that in the last
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:40 - 00:00:48</strong></em>
<br /> ten years the Big 5 have made close to 500 acquisitions worth about $140 billion because consumers like the company's products,
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:48 - 00:00:52</strong></em>
<br /> Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have developed huge market shares.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:52 - 00:00:54</strong></em>
<br /> For example, Amazon receives about 93%
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:54 - 00:00:57</strong></em>
<br /> of all ebook sales Google pulls in about 78%
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:00:57 - 00:01:00</strong></em>
<br /> of Internet search ad spending in EU.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:00 - 00:01:04</strong></em>
<br /> S similarly. Apple and Facebook dominate in high end smartphones and social media traffic,
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:04 - 00:01:07</strong></em>
<br /> but being a monopoly isn't illegal in EU,
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:07 - 00:01:09</strong></em>
<br /> S or most other countries.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:09 - 00:01:12</strong></em>
<br /> Regulators stopped equating big with bad along time ago.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:12 - 00:01:15</strong></em>
<br /> Monopoly cases brought by the US have also dwindled.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:15 - 00:01:19</strong></em>
<br /> In fact, the last high profile case was filed in 1998 when
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:19 - 00:01:29</strong></em>
<br /> the Justice Department successfully challenged Microsoft's dominance of computer operating systems and that 20 year dry spell in monopoly cases has LED some watchdogs to say that enforcement in EU
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:29 - 00:01:30</strong></em>
<br /> S has become too timid.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:30 - 00:01:33</strong></em>
<br /> They say big tech is hurting innovation,
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:33 - 00:01:34</strong></em>
<br /> jobs and wages, and some
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:34 - 00:01:38</strong></em>
<br /> even blame the behemoths for a decline in successful startups in Europe.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:38 - 00:01:42</strong></em>
<br /> America's big tech companies have face more resistance with governments more aggressively pursuing them.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:42 - 00:01:43</strong></em>
<br /> For example,
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:43 - 00:01:49</strong></em>
<br /> the EU has find Google for abusing its market dominance and Germany is investigating Facebook for its privacy practices.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:49 - 00:01:50</strong></em>
<br /> Of course, the big tech
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:50 - 00:01:53</strong></em>
<br /> players don't think they need to be broken up.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:53 - 00:01:59</strong></em>
<br /> They argue their dominance isn't guaranteed because new competitors can easily jump in as Google likes to point out.
<br />
<br />
<br /><em><strong>00:01:59 - 00:02:01</strong></em>
<br /> Competition is just one click away.
